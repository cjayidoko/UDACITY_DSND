## Installation: 
The codes .py and .ipynb files in this repository run on an anaconda and pyspark installed Python environment. The .py files can run on terminal

## Project Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is develop a supervised predictive model that can predict at any point in time if a user is likely to cancel his subscription of sparkify music streaming service. This is based on important metrics the user has recorded since starting the use of the service

## File Descriptions:
The dataset utilized for this study is a big data obtained and provided by Udacity, and thus not publicly available. The dataset is a .json file with record of events of all users on the sparkify streaming platform. These events can be any point say -liking a song, rolling advert, logging out.
The full size is 12 GB and was anylized on a cluster of computers  rented from AWS and using spark. The files on this platform include
 - The 'idokoSparkify.ipynb' file is the notebook used in cleaning, preprocessing, and modelling

## Results: 
The findings of this study are in the repository and published on my medium [here](https://medium.com/@idokochijioke)
